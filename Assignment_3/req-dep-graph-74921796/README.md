DISCLAIMER: Copilot was used to fill in most of the code and I tweaked some of the code to make sure it can run. I have used the previous APIs and module design and software architecture code and functions by myself while also adding new ones. The purpose of this file is the same as it was when I typed it out for Assignment 3. <br/> 1. Graph module (graph.h and graph.c)<br/>Purpose: Manage requirement dependency relationships like storing requirements as graph nodes and handling the memory of the graph. <br/> 2. Parse module (parse.h and parse.c) <br/> Purpose: Analyze the SRS and extract the requirement IDs and dependencies and populate the graph with the analyzed data from the SRS file. <br/> 3. Report module (report.h and report.c) <br/> Purpose: Generate the output of the graph either printing it on console and a file or executable depending on where you ran the source files and get output files <br/> 4. Main module (main.c) <br/> Purpose: Should contain all of the functions of the other files and executes the program. Should handle the line arguments and execution of the program. <br/> Instructions: If you got this from Github, just clone and compile from Vscode. If downloaded from ZIP. Extract however you like and use Vscode to compile. Makefile should compile and run the program.
